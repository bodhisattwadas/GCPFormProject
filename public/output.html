My Executor or Trustee may also divide any transfer in trust provided for hereunder into fractional shares to which all, and none, respectively, of me or my wife&#039;s remaining generation skipping tax exemptions may be allocated, so as to create two separate trusts, the dispositive provisions of which, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, shall be identical to those which would have applied if such transfer had not been divided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">(j)	<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline ;">Elimination of Small Trusts</span>.  My Trustee shall have the discretion to terminate or not establish any trust created or to be created under this will (other than a qualified charitable remainder trust) whenever the total fair market value of the assets of any such trust is so small that my Trustee’s annual fee for administering the trust would be the minimum annual fee set forth in my Trustee’s regularly published fee schedule then in effect, or whenever my Trustee determines it would be contrary to the best interests of the beneficiaries by reason of legislation or unforeseen changes or circumstances to create or continue such a trust, in which event the property then constituting or receivable by such trust shall be distributed to the beneficiaries then entitled to the income of such trust.  If the beneficiaries of such income depend upon the exercise of my Trustee’s discretion, then my Executor or Trustee, as the case may be, shall distribute such property among those beneficiaries and in such proportions as my Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine, and its determination shall be binding and conclusive upon all interested persons.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">	<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline ;">Miscellaneous Provisions</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">(a)	<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline ;">Number, </span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline ;">Gender</span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline ;"> and Captions</span>.  References to &quot;Executor,&quot; &quot;Trustee,&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot; hereunder, and any pronouns used in connection with same, shall be deemed to include masculine, feminine, or neuter forms, or singular or plural forms, in order to reflect the gender and number of the fiduciaries then serving.  The captions or headings of the paragraphs or subparagraphs are inserted solely for the convenience of reference and shall not constitute a part of this Will, nor shall they affect its meaning, construction or effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">(b)	<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline ;">Adopted Descendants</span>.  Whenever the term &quot;descendants&quot; is used in this Will, such references shall be deemed to include any legally adopted child to the extent that they would include a natural born child of the adopting parent, except that they shall exclude any person whose adoption occurs after such person has reached the age of majority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">(c)	<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline ;">Out-of-state Fiduciaries</span>.  Although I may have appointed fiduciaries to serve hereunder (as Executor, Trustee or Guardian) who may not be residents of the state of my residence at the date of my death, it is my specific request that they be allowed to serve in the positions designated, without bond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">(d)	<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline ;">Rule Against Perpetuities</span>.  Anything in this Will to the contrary notwithstanding, all property of every trust created by this Will shall vest in and be distributed to the persons then entitled to the income from such property (or equally to the persons entitled to the income, if there is more than one beneficiary) at the expiration of ninety (90) years, if this Will is still in effect under the laws of Georgia, or if not then at the expiration of twenty-one (21) years after the death of the last surviving beneficiary of this Will who was in life at the date of my death, unless sooner vested as herein provided.  The purpose of this provision is to prevent any possible violation of the rule against perpetuities this provision should be so construed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">(e)	<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline ;">Applicable Law</span>.  The administration and construction of any trust created hereunder and the rights of the beneficiaries thereof shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">(f)	<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline ;">In Terrorem Clause</span>.  Should any beneficiary contest or initiate proceedings to contest the validity of this Will or any provision herein or to prevent any provision herein from being carried out in accordance with its terms (whether or not in good faith and with probable cause), then all the benefits provided for such contesting beneficiary in this Will are revoked and annulled.  Such benefits, if not a part of the residue of my estate, shall go over and become a part of the residue of my estate.  If such contesting beneficiary is a beneficiary under any Item of this Will which disposes of the residue of my estate, such contesting beneficiary shall cease to be a member of the class of beneficiaries to whom distributions are required or permitted to be made under such item.  Upon the final division and distribution of the property passing under such Item, the share to which such contesting beneficiary would otherwise have been entitled shall be held and distributed as if such contesting beneficiary had died immediately prior to such division without exercising any power of appointment which he or she might otherwise have had hereunder.  Any generation-skipping transfer tax which might arise pursuant to this Item shall be paid from such share.  If all of the persons who are beneficiaries of the residue of my estate join in such a contest or proceeding, such residue shall go over and be distributed to or for the benefit of any organization that may receive transfers qualifying for the federal estate tax charitable deduction at the time of the distribution.   This paragraph shall not be effective with regard to any bequest made from my estate which qualifies for the federal estate tax marital deduction.</p>
